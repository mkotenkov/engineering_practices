Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule split_data in file /Users/maksimkoltugin/Code/hse/engineering_practices/Snakefile, line 10:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/splitted/val.csv
Removing output files of failed job split_data since they might be corrupted:
data/splitted/train.csv, data/splitted/test.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
